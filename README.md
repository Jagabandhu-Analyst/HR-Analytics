# HR-Analytics Dashboard and sql queries

## This project showcases an HR Analytics Dashboard built using Power BI, Tableau, and SQL to analyze employee data and provide insights into workforce trends.

Dashboard Overview

The dashboard provides interactive visualizations to track key HR metrics, including:

- Employee Count: Total number of employees for effective workforce assessment
- Attrition Count: Tracks employee attrition to obtain comprehensive data on departed employees
- Attrition Rate: Measures turnover levels for insights into employee satisfaction and engagement
- Active Employees: Differentiates between active and inactive employees for accurate workforce assessment
- Average Age: Examines workforce demographics for succession planning and talent retention

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

1. Average Attrition Rate for All Departments: Tracks overall attrition rates across departments to identify areas for improvement
2. Average Hourly Rate of Male Research Scientist: Analyzes compensation trends for specific job roles and demographics
3. Attrition Rate vs Monthly Income Stats: Examines the relationship between attrition rates and monthly income to identify potential correlations
4. Average Working Years for Each Department: Tracks tenure and experience levels across departments to inform succession planning and talent development
5. Job Role vs Work-Life Balance: Analyzes the impact of job roles on work-life balance to identify areas for improvement
6. Attrition Rate vs Years Since Last Promotion: Examines the relationship between attrition rates and career advancement opportunities to identify potential drivers of turnover
